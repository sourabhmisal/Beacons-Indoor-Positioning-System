# Beacons Indoor Positioning System

The project consists in developing a prototype of an indoor positioning system (IPS) based on low-cost technologies such as BLE Beacons and testing the accuracy achieved with some empirical experiments.
IPSs are often adopted in the context of smart buildings and healthcare (hospitals, clinics â€¦) and our idea is to use trilateration algorithms and beacons for positioning the users (or patients) in a room.
The system is composed by two smartphone apps (Android and IOS), which receives the beacon signals. Then the signals are sent to a Node.js server, which computes the positions and allows visualizing the movements of the user inside the room providing a simple Web interface.

## Project Structure

* The "trilateration_server" folder contains the source code for the HTTP server in Node.js
* The "TrilaterationApp" folder contains the ReactNative project of the Android/IOS client App (ReactNative 0.55.4)

## Libraries

These are the libraries included in our project
* beacon library for React Native: [react-native-beacons-manager](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager)
* trilateration library for Node.js: [trilateration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trilateration)
* JavaScript library for the Web monitoring interface : [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

## React Native App Installing

Before deploying the React Native App, install the project's dependencies in the "TrilaterationApp" folder with npm

```
npm install
```
In the react-native app , add this library for better results , since this library is not updated by the author on the npm website

```
npm i MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager
```
